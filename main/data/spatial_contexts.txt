Like context 1, this came down on flattened large pieces of pottery across the area, especially towards the north.  In the south, the bottom of context 2 was cleared to the top of what appeared to be a wall in the center of the trench, behind which was a loose red soil.

As we dug we also uncovered more medium-sized stone tumble, that seems even more dense.  In fact, we began to come down on some large-sized stones as well in the middle of this context.  This appears to be the densest part of the stone tumble, likely resulting from being above this potential wall in the center of the trench or because it is preserved on a high level of a lower big-stone wall.  Here we would later come down on very large stones probably part of the main city wall.

What was interesting about this context was that it came down onto a significant amount of large pithoi and other pottery fragments (to the north and east) and grinding stones (southwest), that appear to indicate this was an exposed surface upon which vessels were smashed and quickly covered.  This appears to be the same surface upon which context 7 was built.  In the northwest corner, a deeper area of large pithoi fragments was also found - mostly dug as a later context.

Perhaps this was a pit into which a pithos was set, and the other material collected in here.  The relationship with wall context 7 is unclear, but it does not appear that the pit continues under the wall.  Perhaps the pithos was set up against this wall, and held upright by a small pit.

This soil then forms a barrier above the important pithos vessel of contexts 24 and 27.  Thus this soil fill may be the erosion that settled here after the pithos was abandoned and collapsed but before the wall context 6 was constructed.  It is important that it is mostly a soil fill at the top, often with a reddish tint, rather than the type of rock collapse we see in most of the surrounding upper contexts such as 3, 4, 5, and 10.  This is definitely a transition layer, likely with chronological significance between what is above and below.

Already finds context 12 indicated this surface  - though at a bit higher due to the rocks it landed on.

This context 21 spans from the pithos on the east to the western baulk and from the mid-trench possible wall in the north to the south baulk.  However, the rock tumble appears clustered closest to the pithos.  To the west it dwindles, perhaps related to wall context 7.  To the north, it does not seem to continue all the way to the ledge formed by the mid-trench possible wall.

Therefore, stones remained in place on the far west and east sides, but were removed throughout the center.
